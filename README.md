The goal of this project is to fetch the latests commits to https://github.com/electric-capital/crypto-ecosystems . We then find the URLs of the repos of the data files that changed recently by doing a git diff with an older commit. We then fetch the READMEs for these projects. After that we use an LLM to do a summary of all of these projects. At the end what we want is a short document that contains the summary of recent active or new projects in the crypto ecosystem.
